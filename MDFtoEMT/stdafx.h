// Disable warnings about unsafe functions such as sprintf().
// We use the 'unsafe' versions to maintain source-code compatibility with Visual C++ 6.
// Also, I am not convinced that the 'safe' ones are all that much safer. For instance, you 
//  are supposed to specify how many parameters there are in the sprintf format string, but
//  you can just as easily get that wrong as to not pass the right number of parameters to
//  the 'unsafe' version.
